		<p>Concept</p>
		<p>You'll love spending time outdoors in this site plan with landscape and swimming pool. Inside the home, there's a passageway at the entrance; a toilet with a sink on the left; and a larger bathroom with a shower, a washer, twin sinks and a toilet, also on the left. At the end of the passageway are two rooms which can be used as bedrooms. To the right of the main entrance is a door which leads into an open kitchen with a U-shaped counter, a cooking range and a sink. The kitchen looks over a large space which can be set up as a living and dining room. This room has a bow window overlooking the pool outside. The outdoor area consists of a garage, a semi-circular patio with a couch and three armchairs, two umbrellas with seating underneath, a long swimming pool and two lounge chairs.</p></div>

		<p>Entry space</p>
		<p>If you're interested in creating a cozy, inviting spot for your family and friends to hang out at home, you can't go wrong with this outdoor living space layout. The 616 sq. ft. design is made up of a spacious, open grassy area that provides endless options, including entertaining, playing with children, or allowing pets to run freely. The yard is broken up by a modern wooden deck that extends from the home's back door into an L-shape, ending with a circular entertaining area, perfect for an outdoor dining set and oversized umbrella. A gray stone wall encloses one side of the space enhancing bringing in much-needed privacy and enhancing its industrial style. An outdoor conversation set, a few potted plants, and a grill make this attractive backyard the perfect place to relax or entertain on a warm afternoon.</p></div>

		<p>Water in the garden</p>
		<p>If you're going to decorate the interior of your home, then it makes sense to do the same with the exterior as well. This luxury backyard garden design with swimming pool makes great use of the available space to create a lounging, swimming and dining area in your backyard. As soon as you enter the backyard, there is a stone path which leads to the dining area. This area is partially covered by a roof with wooden slats, under which there is a circular dining table and four chairs. The stone path also branches out into a paved gravel path to the left. In the center of the backyard is a small swimming pool which is great for kids to play around in or for adults to take a dip. Next to the pool is a wood-floored lounging area where you can place two lounge chairs.</p></div>

		<p>Lounge zone</p>
		<p>What could be more pleasant and delightful than sitting in the middle of a hot summer day in a shelter of cool and adorable leaves and flowers?
        "Chaos"on the site involves the creation of compositions from a variety of plants that tightly cover the soil and practically do not require maintenance. Such" thickets "are perfect for those gardeners who do not have the opportunity to devote a lot of time to their plantings and at the same time want to have a beautiful site.</p></div>
