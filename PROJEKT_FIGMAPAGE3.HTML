		<p>Concept</p>
		<p>The concept for an unusual self-build project – the brainchild of Swedish architect Emelie Holmberg, situated in unspoiled woodland on the island of Väddö, Sweden – grew out of a realization of changing living and working patterns partly precipitated by the pandemic. Pre-Covid, Emelie had dreamt of a more flexible lifestyle facilitated by technology, allowing her to work remotely wherever she chose, so long as she had internet access.</p></div>

		<p>Idea</p>
		<p>This partly sparked the idea for gimme shelter, which began life as a concept for her own self-build, low-cost home. Today, the house, which stands on a plot that Emelie bought in 2019, comprises two structures. One measures 32 sq m and contains a living room, kitchen, and bathroom; the other occupies 10sq m and houses a bedroom.Each one is skirted by a veranda with a wide overhang that shelters it from the elements. The two houses’ roofs are connected, providing a sheltered outdoor space intended for many uses. The space creates a link between being indoors and out – and is protected from rain, wind, and sun.” There’s also some decking projecting into the woods at right angles to the houses, which reinforces the sense of being immersed in nature.</p></div>

		<p>Interior</p>
		<p>The blurring of boundaries between inside and outside is one of the house’s main attractions. Both living and sleeping cabins have huge windows that maximize views of the natural surroundings. Wooden panels that slide on rails on the outer perimeter of the verandas can shut out views or strong sunlight when needed. These reference Swedish vernacular architecture, says Emelie: “This is a common feature in traditional Swedish barns and cowsheds.” These also reflect her interest in Japanese architecture and its partitioning of spaces with sliding panels.</p></div>

		<p>Lounge zone</p>
		<p>What could be more pleasant and delightful than sitting in the middle of a hot summer day in a shelter of cool and adorable leaves and flowers?
        "Chaos"on the site involves the creation of compositions from a variety of plants that tightly cover the soil and practically do not require maintenance. Such" thickets "are perfect for those gardeners who do not have the opportunity to devote a lot of time to their plantings and at the same time want to have a beautiful site.</p></div>
